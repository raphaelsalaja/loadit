## Why would you use this? 🔎

Downloading images can be rather labourious on reddit, especially if you want the full quality version. Also, reddit implements a feature where gallaries are converted to webp format which can make it a pain to download. Loadit fixes all these issues in one click. It handles the conversions and downloads it in full quality straight to your pc.

I have also made it free and open source so if you would like to request any more features, or add them in yourself, you can check out the github page. You can also raise issues here for me aswell.

## Using The Application 🔥

Simply naviagate to an image on the reddit domain, then right click and select the loadit option. It will then download the image to your download folder for your own personal use.

## Local Installation 🏠
 
 - Download and extract the contents
 - In Chrome, open chrome://extensions/
 - Click + Developer mode
 - Click Load unpacked extension…
 - Navigate to the src folder and click OK
 - Enable The Extension
